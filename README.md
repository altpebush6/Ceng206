*Ceng206 Hide And Seek Game Project*

###### Report
>    In this project, we implemented a hide-and-seek game by using C++ with Unreal Engine 5. We designed our game to be split screen. It allows players to control one character with the keyboard and the other character with a gamepad simultaneously. Our game provides users with a visually appealing and immersive experience, both in terms of graphics and physics. 

>    We have implemented the following controls in our game: using the "WASD" keys on the keyboard for movement, the “left shift” key for running, the “space” key for jumping, and the mouse for looking around. On the gamepad, players can use the left analog stick for walking, the right analog stick for looking around, the button "3" for jumping, and the “R1” button for running. In a dark map, where players are equipped with flashlights, the objective for both players is to capture randomly moving ghosts. The player who captures the most ghosts wins the game.
